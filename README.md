HeartBit is a React app used to practice interviewing. It monitors characteristics such as heart beats per minute, facial expressions, and posture. Heartbeats are monitored via a Fitbit, and facial expressions and posture are monitored through a model trained with TensorFlow and [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose).

Built at Hack the North 2018.
